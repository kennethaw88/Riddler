# Can You Hop Across The Chessboard? (23 July 2021)

## Express

The following 8-by-8 grid is covered with a total of 64 chess pieces, with one piece on each square.
You should begin this puzzle at the white bishop on the green square.
You can then move from white piece to white piece via the following rules:

* If you are on a pawn, move up one space diagonally (left or right).
* If you are on a knight, move in an “L” shape—two spaces up, down, left or right, and then one space in a perpendicular direction.
* If you are on a bishop, move one space in any diagonal direction.
* If you are on a rook, move one space up, down, left or right.
* If you are on a queen, move one space in any direction (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).

For example, suppose your first move from the bishop is diagonally down and to the right.
Now you're at a white rook, so your possible moves are left or up to a pawn or right to a knight.

Your objective is to reach one of the four black kings on the grid.
However, at no point can you land on any of the other black pieces.
(Knights are allowed to hop over the black pieces.)

What sequence of moves will allow you to reach a king?

## Classic

Today marks the beginning of the Summer Olympics!
One of the brand-new events this year is sport climbing, in which competitors try their hands (and feet) at lead climbing, speed climbing and bouldering.

Suppose the event's organizers accidentally forgot to place all the climbing holds on and had to do it last-minute for their 10-meter wall (the regulation height for the purposes of this riddle).
Climbers won't have any trouble moving horizontally along the wall.
However, climbers can't move between holds that are more than 1 meter apart vertically.

In a rush, the organizers place climbing holds randomly until there are no vertical gaps between climbing holds (including the bottom and top of the wall).
Once they are done placing the holds, how many will there be on average (not including the bottom and top of the wall)?

*Extra credit*: Now suppose climbers find it just as difficult to move horizontally as vertically, meaning they can't move between any two holds that are more than 1 meter apart in any direction.
Suppose also that the climbing wall is a 10-by-10 meter square.
If the organizers again place the holds randomly, how many have to be placed on average until it's possible to climb the wall?
