## Express

You're playing the (single) Jeopardy! Round, and your opponents are simply no match for you.
You choose first and never relinquish control, working your way horizontally across the board by first selecting all six $200 clues, then all six $400 clues, and so on, until you finally select all the $1,000 clues.
You respond to each clue correctly before either of your opponents can.

One randomly selected clue is a Daily Double.
Rather than award you the prize money associated with that clue, it instead allows you to double your current winnings or wager up to $1,000 should you have less than that.
Being the aggressive player you are, you always bet the most you can.
(In reality, the Daily Double is more likely to appear in certain locations on the board than others, but for this problem assume it has an equal chance of appearing anywhere on the board.)

How much money do you expect to win during the Jeopardy! round?

*Extra credit*: Suppose you change your strategy.
Instead of working your way horizontally across the board, you select random clues from anywhere on the board, one at a time.
Now how much money do you expect to win during the Jeopardy! round?

## Classic

Football season is in full swing, and with it have been some incredible blown leads.
The Atlanta Falcons know a few things about this, not to mention a certain Super Bowl from a few years back.
Inspired by these improbabilities, Angela wondered just how likely one blown lead truly is.

The Georgia Birds and the Michigan Felines play a game where they flip a fair coin 101 times.
In the end, if heads comes up at least 51 times, the Birds win; but if tails comes up at least 51 times, the Felines win.

What's the probability that the Birds have at least a 99 percent chance of winning at *some point* during the game—meaning their probability of victory is 99 percent or greater given the flips that remain—and then proceed to lose?

*Extra credit*: Instead of 101 total flips, suppose there are many, many more (i.e., consider the limit as the number of flips goes to infinity).
Again, the Birds win if heads comes up at least half the time.
*Now* what's the probability that the Birds have a win probability of at least 99 percent at some point and then proceed to lose?
