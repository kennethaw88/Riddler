## Express

From Thomas Sneller comes a puzzle that brings us back to the game show to end all game shows, “Who Wants to Be a Riddler Millionaire?”
As you'll remember, for each question you must pick the correct option from four choices.

You've made it to the $1 million question, but it's a tough one.
Out of the four choices, A, B, C and D, you're 70 percent sure the answer is B, and none of the remaining choices looks more plausible than another.
You decide to use your final lifeline, the 50:50, which leaves you with two possible answers, one of them correct. Lo and behold, B remains an option!
How confident are you now that B is the correct answer?


## Classic

The classic birthday problem asks about how many people need to be in a room together before you have better-than-even odds that at least two of them have the same birthday.
Ignoring leap years, the answer is, paradoxically, only 23 people—fewer than you might intuitively think.

But Joel noticed something interesting about a well-known group of 100 people: In the U.S. Senate, *three* senators happen to share the same birthday of October 20: Kamala Harris, Brian Schatz and Sheldon Whitehouse.

And so Joel has thrown a new wrinkle into the classic birthday problem.
How many people do you need to have better-than-even odds that at least *three* of them have the same birthday?
(Again, ignore leap years.)
