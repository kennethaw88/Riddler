# Can You Outthink The Sphinx? (2 April 2021)

## Express

You and Wenjun are playing a game in which you alternate taking turns, removing pennies from a pile.
On your turn, you can remove either one or two pennies from the pile.
On Wenjun's turn, he can remove either two or three pennies.
Whoever takes the last penny *loses*.
(If there is only one penny left and it's Wenjun's turn, then he skips his turn, which means you will lose).
Suppose both you and Wenjun play optimally.

1) If you go first, then what initial numbers of pennies mean *you* will win the game?

2) If Wenjun goes first, then what initial numbers of pennies mean *he* will win the game?

## Classic

You will be asked four seemingly arbitrary true-or-false questions by the Sphinx on a topic about which you know absolutely nothing.
Before the first question is asked, you have exactly $1.
For each question, you can bet any non-negative amount of money that you will answer correctly.
That is, you can bet any real number (including fractions of pennies) between zero and the current amount of money you have.
After each of your answers, the Sphinx reveals the correct answer.
If you are right, you gain the amount of money you bet; if you are wrong, you lose the money you bet.

However, there's a catch.
(Isn't there always, with the Sphinx?)
The answer will *never* be the same for three questions in a row.

With this information in hand, what is the *maximum* amount of money you can be sure that you'll win, *no matter what* the answers wind up being?

*Extra credit*: This riddle can be generalized so that the Sphinx asks *N* questions, such that the answer is never the same for *Q* questions in a row. What are your maximum guaranteed winnings in terms of *N* and *Q*?
