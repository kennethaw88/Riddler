## Express

Riddler Township is having its quadrennial presidential election.
Each of the town''s 10 “shires” is allotted a certain number of electoral votes: two, plus one additional vote for every 10 citizens (rounded to the nearest 10).

The names and populations of the 10 shires are summarized in the table below.

<table>
<tr><td>Shire</td><td>Population</td><td>Electoral Votes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oneshire</td><td>11</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Twoshire</td><td>21</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Threeshire</td><td>31</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fourshire</td><td>41</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fiveshire</td><td>51</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sixshire</td><td>61</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sevenshire</td><td>71</td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Eightshire</td><td>81</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nineshire</td><td>91</td><td>11</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tenshire</td><td>101</td><td>12</td></tr>
</table>

As you may know, under this sort of electoral system, it is quite possible for a presidential candidate to lose the popular vote and still win the election.

If there are two candidates running for president of Riddler Township, and every single citizen votes for one or the other, then what is the *lowest* percentage of the popular vote that a candidate can get while still winning the election?


## Classic

The tortoise and the hare are about to begin a 10-mile race along a “stretch” of road.
The tortoise is driving a car that travels 60 miles per hour, while the hare is driving a car that travels 75 miles per hour.
(For the purposes of this problem, assume that both cars accelerate from 0 miles per hour to their cruising speed instantaneously.)

The hare does a quick mental calculation and realizes if it waits until two minutes have passed, they'll cross the finish line at the exact same moment.
And so, when the race begins, the tortoise drives off while the hare patiently waits.

But one minute into the race, after the tortoise has driven 1 mile, something extraordinary happens.
The road turns out to be magical and instantaneously stretches by 10 miles!
As a result of this stretching, the tortoise is now 2 miles ahead of the hare, who remains at the starting line.

At the end of every subsequent minute, the road stretches by 10 miles.
With this in mind, the hare does some more mental math.

How long after the race has begun should the hare wait so that both the tortoise and the hare will cross the finish line at the same exact moment?
