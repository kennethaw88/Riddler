# Can You Pass The Cranberry Sauce?  (20 November 2020)

## Express

Depending on the year, there can be one, two or three Friday the 13ths.
Last week happened to be the second Friday the 13th of 2020.

What is the *greatest* number of Friday the 13ths that can occur over the course of four consecutive calendar years?

*Extra credit*: What's the greatest number of Friday the 13ths that can occur over a four-year period (i.e., a period that doesn't necessarily begin on January 1)?

## Classic

To celebrate Thanksgiving, you and 19 of your family members are seated at a circular table (socially distanced, of course).
Everyone at the table would like a helping of cranberry sauce, which happens to be in front of you at the moment.

Instead of passing the sauce around in a circle, you pass it randomly to the person seated directly to your left or to your right.
They then do the same, passing it randomly either to the person to *their* left or right.
This continues until everyone has, at some point, received the cranberry sauce.

Of the 20 people in the circle, who has the greatest chance of being the *last* to receive the cranberry sauce?
