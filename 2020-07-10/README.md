#Can You Make 24? (10 July 2020)

## Express

The 24 Game is a fun test of mathematical fluency.
In the Riddler version of the game, your goal is to make a numerical expression that equals 24, using each of four given numbers once, along with parentheses, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation.

For example, if I gave you the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 8, then valid solutions would be 8×3×(2−1) and (3+1)×(8−2), since they both equal 24.
However, concatenation is not an allowed operation, which means (32−8)×1 is not a solution — that is, you can’t smush the 3 and the 2 together to get 32.

Given the four numbers 2, 3, 3 and 4, how can you make 24?

## Classic

Mira has a toy with five rings of different diameters and a tapered column.
Each ring has a “correct” position on the column, from the largest ring that fits snugly at the bottom to the smallest ring that fits snugly at the top.

Each ring she places will slide down to its correct position, if possible.
Otherwise, it will rest on what was previously the topmost ring.

For example, if Mira stacks the smallest ring first, then she cannot stack any more rings on top.
But if she stacks the second-smallest ring first, then she can stack any one of the remaining four rings above it, after which she cannot stack any more rings.

Here are a four different stacks Mira could make:

This got Mira thinking. How many unique stacks can she create using at least one ring?

*Extra credit*: Instead of five rings, suppose the toy has *N* rings.
Now how many unique stacks can Mira create?
