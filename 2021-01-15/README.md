## Express

You're a contestant on the hit new game show, “You Bet Your Fife.”
On the show, a random real number (i.e., decimals are allowed) is chosen between 0 and 100.
Your job is to guess a value that is *less than* this randomly chosen number.
Your reward for winning is a novelty fife that is valued precisely at your guess.
For example, if the number is 75 and you guess 5, you'd win a $5 fife, but if you'd guessed 60, you'd win a $60 fife.
Meanwhile, a guess of 80 would win you nothing.

What number should you guess to maximize the average value of your fifing winnings?

## Classic

There are eight three-digit numbers—each belongs in a row of the table below, with one digit per cell.
The products of the three digits of each number are shown in the rightmost column.
Meanwhile, the products of the digits in the hundreds, tens, and ones places, respectively, are shown in the bottom row.

Can you find all eight three-digit numbers and complete the table?
It's a bit of a mystery, but I'm sure you have it within you to hunt down the answer!
