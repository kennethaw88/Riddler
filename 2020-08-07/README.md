# Can You Reach The Beach? (7 August 2020)

## Express

The Riddler Isles are a chain of small islands on the Constant Sea.
One of them, Euclid Island, is perfectly rectangular and measures 3 miles long by 2 miles wide.
While walking across the island on a recent vacation, I was often interested in locating the point on the shore that was nearest to my current position.

One morning, I realized that from where I was standing there were *two* distinct points on the shore that were *both* the closest such points.
I was excited by my discovery, only to realize it had been made years earlier.
It turned out I was on a hiking trail that connected all such locations on the island—those with multiple nearest points on the shore.

What is the total length of this trail on Euclid Island?

*Extra credit*: Al-Battani Island is another of the Riddler Isles, but it's elliptical rather than rectangular.
Al-Battani Island's major axis is 3 miles long, while its minor axis is 2 miles long.
Like Euclid Island, Al-Battani Island has a hiking trail that connects all locations with multiple nearest points on the shore.
What is the total length of this trail on Al-Battani Island?

## Classic

We usually think of addition as an operation applied to a field like the rational numbers or the real numbers.
And there is good reason for that—as Kareem says, “Mathematicians have done all the hard work of figuring out how to make calculations track with reality.
They kept modifying and refining the number system until everything worked out.
It took centuries of brilliant minds to do this!”

Now suppose we defined addition another (admittedly less useful) way, using a classic model organism: the nematode.
To compute the sum of *x* and *y*, you combine groups of *x* and *y* nematodes and leave them for 24 hours.
When you come back, you count up how many you have—and that's the sum!

It turns out that, over the course of 24 hours, the nematodes pair up, and each pair has one offspring 50 percent of the time.
(If you have an odd number of nematodes, they will still pair up, but one will be left out.)
So if you want to compute 1+1, half the time you'll get 2 and half the time you'll get 3.
If you compute 2+2, 25 percent of the time you get 4, 50 percent of the time you'll get 5, and 25 percent of the time you'll get 6.

While we're at it, let's define exponentiation for sums of nematodes.
Raising a sum to a power means leaving that sum of nematodes for the number of days specified by the exponent.

With this number system, what is the expected value of (1+1)<sup>4</sup>?

*Extra credit*: As *N* gets larger and larger, what does the expected value of (1+1)<sup><i>N</i></sup> approach?
