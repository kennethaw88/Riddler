# Can You Stick It To The Genie? (12 November 2021)

## Express

I have three dice (d4, d6, d8) on my desk that I fiddle with while working, much to the chagrin of my co-workers.
For the uninitiated, the d4 is a tetrahedron that is equally likely to land on any of its four faces (numbered 1 through 4), the d6 is a cube that is equally likely to land on any of its six faces (numbered 1 through 6), and the d8 is an octahedron that is equally likely to land on any of its eight faces (numbered 1 through 8).

I like to play a game in which I roll all three dice in “numerical” order: d4, then d6 and then d8.
I win this game when the three rolls form a strictly increasing sequence (such as 2-4-7, but *not* 2-4-4).
What is my probability of winning?

*Extra credit*: Instead of three dice, I now have six dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20.
If I roll all six dice in “numerical” order, what is the probability I'll get a strictly increasing sequence?

## Classic

One day you stumble across a magic genie, who says that if you play a simple game with him, you could win fabulous riches.
You take the genie up on his offer, and he hands you a stick of length 1.
He says that behind his back is another stick, with a random length between 0 and 1 (chosen uniformly over that interval).

Next, you must break your stick into two pieces and present one of those pieces to the genie.
If that piece is longer than the genie's hidden stick, then you win a prize of $1 million times the length of your remaining piece.
For example, if you present to the genie a length of 0.4, and that's longer than the genie's stick, then you win $1 million times 0.6, or $600,000.
However, if the genie's stick is longer, then you win nothing.

Being a regular reader of The Riddler, you crunch some numbers and prepare to break your stick in half.
But then you have a thought.
You ask the genie if you can have more than one turn.
For example, if you present the genie with a length of 0.4, but the genie's stick is longer, can you break off a piece of the remaining length of 0.6—say, a length of 0.5—and then present *that* to the genie?
To keep things fair, your winnings will still be proportional to the leftover length.
So had the genie's length indeed been between 0.4 and 0.5, your first and second guesses, then the remaining length would have been 0.1, and you would have won $100,000.

The genie doesn't think any of this really matters and says you can have as many turns as you desire.
If your goal is to maximize your expected winnings, what will your strategy be?
And how much money would you expect to win on average?
