\section*{Riddle:}

I have three dice (d4, d6, d8) on my desk that I fiddle with while working, much to the chagrin of my co-workers.
For the uninitiated, the d4 is a tetrahedron that is equally likely to land on any of its four faces (numbered 1 through 4), the d6 is a cube that is equally likely to land on any of its six faces (numbered 1 through 6), and the d8 is an octahedron that is equally likely to land on any of its eight faces (numbered 1 through 8).

I like to play a game in which I roll all three dice in ``numerical'' order: d4, then d6 and then d8.
I win this game when the three rolls form a strictly increasing sequence (such as 2-4-7, but \textit{not} 2-4-4).
What is my probability of winning?

\textit{Extra credit}: Instead of three dice, I now have six dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20.
If I roll all six dice in ``numerical'' order, what is the probability Iâ€™ll get a strictly increasing sequence?


\section*{Solution:}

There are $4\times6\times8=192$ possible ways to roll the three dice in order.
That is in the range where it is possible to list out every winning combination.
I've listed out those combinations here:

\vspace{0.1in}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular*}{3.5in}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}cccccc}
1-2-3 & 1-3-6 & 1-5-7 & 2-3-8 & 2-6-7 & 3-5-8 \\
1-2-4 & 1-3-7 & 1-5-8 & 2-4-5 & 2-6-8 & 3-6-7 \\
1-2-5 & 1-3-8 & 1-6-7 & 2-4-6 & 3-4-5 & 3-6-8 \\
1-2-6 & 1-4-5 & 1-6-8 & 2-4-7 & 3-4-6 & 4-5-6 \\
1-2-7 & 1-4-6 & 2-3-4 & 2-4-8 & 3-4-7 & 4-5-7 \\
1-2-8 & 1-4-7 & 2-3-5 & 2-5-6 & 3-4-8 & 4-5-8 \\
1-3-4 & 1-4-8 & 2-3-6 & 2-5-7 & 3-5-6 & 4-6-7 \\
1-3-5 & 1-5-6 & 2-3-7 & 2-5-8 & 3-5-7 & 4-6-8 \\
\end{tabular*}
\end{center}
\vspace{0.1in}

That is a total of 48 combinations, which means the solution is \nicefrac{48}{192}, or
\fcolorbox{red}{white}{$\bm{{\nicefrac{1}{4}}}$}\,.

Another way of looking at the first solution is that there are six combinations that begin 1-2, five that begin 1-3, four that begin 1-4, three that begin 1-5, and two that begin 1-6.
Similarly, there are five combinations that begin 2-3, four that begin 2-4, three that begin 2-5, and two that begin 2-6.
Then there are four that begin 3-4, three that begin 3-5, and two that begin 3-6.
Finally there are three that begin 4-5 and two that begin 4-6.
These can be written as a sum:

\[
\sum_{j=3}^{6}\ \sum_{i=2}^{j}\ i
\]

which indeed gives the solution of 48.

I starting writing out the winning combinations for the six-dice problem.
It yields similar (though much larger) patterns of winning combinations.
For example, there are 15 combinations that begin 1-2-3-4-5, 14 that begin 1-2-3-4-6, etc., down to eight solutions that begin 1-2-3-4-12.
Extending this pattern ultimately gives the sum:

\[
\sum_{m=12}^{15}\ \sum_{l=11}^{m}\ \sum_{k=10}^{l}\ \sum_{j=9}^{k}\ \sum_{i=8}^{j}\ i
\]

This has a total sum of 5,434.
I don't have an explanation for each of the indices in the sum, but it seems to work.
Because there are $4\times6\times8\times10\times12\times20=460{,}800$ possible rolls, this means the solution is \nicefrac{5,434}{460,800}, or
\fcolorbox{red}{white}{$\bm{{\nicefrac{2,717}{230,400}\approx0.01179}}$}\,.
