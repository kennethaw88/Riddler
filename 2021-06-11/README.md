# Can You Split The States? (11 June 2021)

## Express

You've been hired to design a new logo for Riddler City.
The mayor is a little eccentric and has requested that the logo have at least two lines of symmetry that intersect at an angle of precisely 1 radian, or 180/ùúã (approximately 57.3) degrees.

What sorts of logos meet the mayor's requirements?
(You can give one example or describe what all possible logos have in common.)

## Classic

Earlier this month, Adam Kotsko asked the Twitterverse to choose four contiguous U.S. states for a new breakaway nation:

This got Philip Bump wondering about states you could pick such that the remaining (previously) contiguous states were no longer contiguous, but rather broken up into two near-halves by area.
Treating the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as distinct from the Lower Peninsula, Philip hypothesized that removing Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma and New Mexico would create two near-equal halves.

Suppose you remove a set of states (not necessarily four) so that you have two distinct contiguous regions among the lower 48 states, where the larger region has area *A* and the smaller region has area *B*.
What states should you remove to maximize area *B*?
(Was Philip's intuition correct?) And what percentage of the lower 48 states' combined area does *B* represent?

For reference, [here](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2010/geo/state-area.html) are the areas of the states according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Like Philip, you can treat Michigan's peninsulas as distinct ‚Äústates‚Äù here.
Michigan's Upper Peninsula has an area of 16,377 square miles.
Also, don't worry about islands, Minnesota's Northwest Angle, etc.‚Äîyou can assume they are contiguous with the rest of their respective states.
