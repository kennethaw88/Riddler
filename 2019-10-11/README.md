## Express

An auditorium with 200 seats, numbered from 1 to 200, is filled to capacity.
A speaker, who happens to be a mathematician, steps up to the podium overlooking the audience and pauses for a moment.
“You know,” she says, “I'm thinking of a rather large whole number.
Every seat number in this auditorium evenly divides my number, except for two of them—and those two seats happen to be next to each other.”

As you'd expect, adjacent seats in the auditorium have consecutive numbers.
Which two numbers was the speaker referring to?


## Classic

Last year, Riddler Nation tackled a puzzle from Mike Donner about wartime navigation.
An enemy submarine determined to sink your ship was exactly halfway between you and your home port.
Your ship had no further information about the submarine's subsequent movement.
The sub had to be directly underneath your ship to sink it, but the sub could track your moves with precision and respond efficiently.
How much faster than the sub did your ship have to be to guarantee you could avoid the sub and get home?

It turned out your ship needed to be about 2.33 times faster than the sub.
This is demonstrated by the animation below: The expanding pink circle is the region where the sub could be located after a given amount of time, and the blue curve represents your ship's course around it.

This week, aware of your mathematical prowess, the enemy has deployed *two* submarines so that your ship, the submarines and the harbor you seek are evenly spaced along a straight line.

If both subs travel at the same speed, how much faster than the subs does your ship have to be to guarantee that you can avoid them and reach the harbor?

**Extra Credit**: Suppose there are *N* submarines evenly spaced between your ship and the harbor.
How much faster than the subs must your ship be?
