# Can You Find A Trio Of Squares? (7 May 2021)

## Express

Can you find three distinct numbers such that the second is the square of the first, the third is the square of the second, and the first is the square of the third?
Assuming you can, what are three such numbers?

*Extra credit*: Can you find *three other* numbers with the same property?

## Classic

Martina and Olivia each secretly generate their own random real number, selected uniformly between 0 and 1.
Starting with Martina, they take turns declaring (so the other can hear) who they think probably has the greater number until the first moment they agree.
Throughout this process, their respective numbers do not change.
So for example, their dialogue might go as follows:

Martina: My number is probably bigger.

Olivia: My number is probably bigger.

Martina: My number is probably bigger.

Olivia: My number is probably bigger.

Martina: Olivia's number is probably bigger.

They are playing as a team, hoping to maximize the chances they correctly predict who has the greater number.

For any given round with randomly generated numbers, what is the probability that the person they agree on really does have the bigger number?

*Extra credit*: Martina and Olivia change the rules so that they stop when Olivia first says that she agrees with Martina.
That is, if Martina says on her turn that she agrees with Olivia, that is not a condition for stopping.
Again, if they play to maximizing their chances, what is the probability that the person they agree on really does have the bigger number?
