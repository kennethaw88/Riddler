## Express

Riddler Nation is competing against Conundrum Country at an Olympic archery event.
Each team fires three arrows toward a circular target 70 meters away.
Hitting the bull's-eye earns a team 10 points, while regions successively farther away from the bull's-eye are worth fewer and fewer points.

Whichever team has more points after three rounds wins.
However, if the teams are tied after each team has taken three shots, both sides will fire another three arrows.
(If they remain tied, they will continue firing three arrows each until the tie is broken.)

For every shot, each archer of Riddler Nation has a one-third chance of hitting the bull's-eye (i.e., earning 10 points), a one-third chance of earning 9 points and a one-third chance of earning 5 points.

Meanwhile, each archer of Conundrum Country earns 8 points with every arrow.

## Classic

Suppose you have a chain with infinitely many flat (i.e., one-dimensional) links.
The first link has length 1, and the length of each successive link is a fraction *f* of the previous link's length.
As you might expect, *f* is less than 1.
You place the chain flat on a table and some ink at the very end of the chain (i.e., the end with the infinitesimal links).

Initially, the chain forms a straight line segment, and the longest link is fixed in place.
From there, the links are constrained to move in a very specific way: The angle between each chain and the next, smaller link is always the same throughout the chain.
For example, if the *N*<sup>th</sup> link and the *N*+1<sup>st</sup> link form a 40 degree clockwise angle, then so do the *N*+1<sup>st</sup> link and the *N*+1<sup>nd</sup> link.

After you move the chain around as much as you can, what shape is drawn by the ink that was at the tail end of the chain?
