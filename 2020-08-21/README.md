## Express

When you started your doctorate several years ago, your astrophysics lab noticed some unusual signals coming in from deep space on a particular frequency—hydrogen times tau.
After analyzing a trove of data measured at many regular intervals, you compute that you heard zero signals in 45 percent of the intervals, one signal in 38 percent of the intervals and two signals in the remaining 17 percent of the intervals.

Your research adviser suggests that it may just be random fluctuations from *two* sources.
Each source had some fixed probability of emitting a signal that you picked up, and together those sources generated the pattern in your data.

What do you think?
Was it possible for your data to have come from two random fluctuations, as your adviser suggests?

## Classic

Quarantined in your apartment, you decide to entertain yourself by building a large pen for your pet hamster.
To create the pen, you have several vertical posts, around which you will wrap a sheet of fabric.
The sheet is 1 meter long—meaning the perimeter of your pen can be at most 1 meter—and weighs 1 kilogram, while each post weighs *k* kilograms.

Over the course of a typical day, your hamster gets bored and likes to change rooms in your apartment.
That means you want your pen to be lightweight and easy to move between rooms.
The total weight of the posts and the fabric you use should not exceed 1 kilogram.

For example, if *k* = 0.2, then you could make an equilateral triangle with a perimeter of 0.4 meters (since 0.4 meters of the sheet would weigh 0.4 kilograms), or you could make a square with perimeter of 0.2 meters.
However, you couldn't make a pentagon, since the weight of five posts would already hit the maximum and leave no room for the sheet.

You want to figure out the best shape in order to enclose the largest area possible.
What's the greatest value of *k* for which you should use four posts rather than three?

*Extra credit*: For which values of *k* should you use five posts, six posts, seven posts, and so on?
