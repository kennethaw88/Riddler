## Express

A bag contains 100 marbles, and each marble is one of three different colors.
If you were to draw three marbles at random, the probability that you would get one of each color is *exactly* 20 percent.

How many marbles of each color are in the bag?

## Classic

Riddler solitaire is played with 11 cards: an ace, a two, a three, a four, a five, a six, a seven, an eight, a nine, a 10 and a joker.
Each card is worth its face value in points, while the ace counts for 1 point.
To play a game, you shuffle the cards so they are randomly ordered, and then turn them over one by one.
You start with 0 points, and as you flip over each card your score increases by that card's pointsâ€”as long as the joker hasn't shown up.
The moment the joker appears, the game is over and your score is 0.
The key is that you can stop any moment and walk away with a nonzero score.

What strategy maximizes your expected number of points?
