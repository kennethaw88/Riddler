# Can You Solve This Astronomical Enigma? (9 July 2021)

## Express

Earlier this year, a new generation of Brood X cicadas had emerged in many parts of the U.S.
This particular brood emerges every 17 years, while some other cicada broods emerge every 13 years.
Both 13 and 17 are prime numbers—and relatively prime with one another—which means these broods are rarely in phase with other predators or each other.
In fact, cicadas following a 13-year cycle and cicadas following a 17-year cycle will only emerge in the same season once every 221 (i.e., 13 times 17) years!

Now, suppose there are two broods of cicadas, with periods of *A* and *B* years, that have just emerged in the same season.
However, these two broods can also interfere with each other one year *after* they emerge due to a resulting lack of available food.
For example, if *A* is 5 and *B* is 7, then *B*'s emergence in year 14 (i.e., 2 times 7) means that when *A* emerges in year 15 (i.e., 3 times 5) there won't be enough food to go around.

If both *A* and *B* are relatively prime and are both less than or equal to 20, what is the longest stretch these two broods can go without interfering with one another's cycle?
(Remember, both broods just emerged this year.)
For example, if *A* is *5* and B is 7, then the interference would occur in year 15.

## Classic

This time, they have identified three planets that circularly orbit a neighboring star.
Planet A is three astronomical units away from its star and completes its orbit in three years.
Planet B is four astronomical units away from the star and completes its orbit in four years.
Finally, Planet C is five astronomical units away from the star and completes its orbit in five years.

They report their findings to Xiddler's Grand Minister, along with the auspicious news that all three planets are currently lined up (i.e., they are collinear) with their star.
However, the Grand Minister is far more interested in the three planets than the star and wants to know how long it will be until the planets are next aligned.

How many years will it be until the three planets are again collinear (not necessarily including the star)?
