#Can You Parallel Park Your Car? (9 October 2020)

## Express

Every weekend, I drive into town for contactless curbside pickup at a local restaurant.
Across the street from the restaurant are six parking spots, lined up in a row.

While I *can* parallel park, it's definitely not my preference.
No parallel parking is required when the rearmost of the six spots is available or when there are two consecutive open spots.
If there is a random arrangement of cars currently occupying four of the six spots, what's the probability that I will have to parallel park?

## Classic

Parking cars is one thing—parking trucks is another thing entirely.
Suppose I'm driving a *very long* truck (with length *L*) with two front wheels and two rear wheels.
(The truck is so long compared to its width that I can consider the two front wheels as being a single wheel, and the two rear wheels as being a single wheel.)

Question 1: Suppose I can rotate the front wheels up to 30 degrees in either direction (right or left), but the rear wheels do not turn.
What is the truck's turning radius?

Question 2: Suppose I can also rotate the rear wheels—independently from the front wheels—30 degrees in either direction.
*Now* what is the truck's turning radius?
