# Can You Cut The Square … Into More Squares?  (8 January 2021)

## Express

There are many ways to slice a big square into smaller squares (not necessarily of equal size), so that the smaller squares don't overlap, while still making up the entire area of the big square.

For example, you can slice the big square into four smaller squares, each a quarter of the area of the big square.
Or you could slice it into seven squares, if you take one of those four squares and slice it into four yet smaller squares.

What whole numbers of squares can you *not* slice the big square into?

## Classic

Robin of Foxley has entered the FiveThirtyEight archery tournament.
Her aim is excellent (relatively speaking), as she is guaranteed to hit the circular target, which has no subdivisions—it's just one big circle.
However, her arrows are equally likely to hit each location within the target.

Her true love, Marian, has issued a challenge.
Robin must fire as many arrows as she can, such that each arrow is closer to the center of the target than the previous arrow.
For example, if Robin fires three arrows, each closer to the center than the previous, but the fourth arrow is farther than the third, then she is done with the challenge and her score is *four*.

On average, what score can Robin expect to achieve in this archery challenge?

*Extra credit*: Marian now uses a target with 10 concentric circles, whose radii are 1, 2, 3, etc., all the way up to 10—the radius of the entire target.
This time, Robin must fire as many arrows as she can, such that each arrow falls within a smaller concentric circle than the previous arrow.
On average, what score can Robin expect to achieve in *this* version of the archery challenge?
