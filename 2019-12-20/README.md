# Can You Find A Matching Pair Of Socks? (20 December 2019)

## Express

You’re new at your job, and your office is voting on a theme for its holiday party.
It’s fallen on you to record the percent of your coworkers (including yourself) who voted for each one.
Well, since you’re in a hurry, you just write down everything in the percentage that comes before the decimal point.
So for example, 35.0 percent, 35.17 percent and 35.92 percent would all be written simply as “35 percent.”

After the votes are tallied, you found that the winner received 73 percent of the vote (at least, that’s what you wrote down), while second place had 58 percent, and third place had 32 percent.
Your first realization is that you work with a bunch of cheaters who voted more than once.
But your second thought is that you might be able to use this information to figure out how many people work in your office.
(As I said, you’re new, and this isn’t something you know off the top of your head.)

Based on these percentages, what’s the minimum number of people who could work in your office?

*Extra credit*: Your office could be filled with many possible numbers of people. Based on the percentages given in the problem, what’s the greatest number of people your office *can’t* have?

## Classic

I have 10 pairs of socks in a drawer.
Each pair is distinct from another and consists of two matching socks.
Alas, I’m negligent when it comes to folding my laundry, and so the socks are not folded into pairs.
This morning, fumbling around in the dark, I pull the socks out of the drawer, randomly and one at a time, until I have a matching pair of socks among the ones I’ve removed from the drawer.

On average, how many socks will I pull out of the drawer in order to get my first matching pair?

(Note: This is different from asking how many socks I must pull out of the drawer to *guarantee* that I have a matching pair.
The answer to *that* question, by the pigeonhole principle, is 11 socks.
This question is instead asking about the *average*.)

*Extra credit*: Instead of 10 pairs of socks, what if I have some large number *N* pairs of socks?
