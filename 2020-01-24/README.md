# How Many Pennies Should You Pinch? (24 January 2020)

## Express

Derek Jeter and Larry Walker were just elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame!
That got Stephanie thinking.
Suppose there are 20 players on the ballot and 400 voters in a given year.
Each voter can select up to 10 players for induction without voting for any given player more than once.
To gain entry, a player must have been selected on at least 75 percent of the ballots.

Under these circumstances, what is the *maximum* number of players that can be inducted into the Hall of Fame?

## Classic

The game starts with somewhere between 20 and 30 pennies, which I then divide into two piles any way I like. Then we alternate taking turns, with you first, until someone wins the game. For each turn, a player may take any number of pennies he or she likes from either pile, or instead take the same number of pennies from both piles. Each player must also take at least one penny every turn. The winner of the game is the one who takes the last penny.

If we both play optimally, what starting numbers of pennies (again, between 20 and 30) guarantee that you can win the game?
