## Express

In the World Series, one team hosts Games 1, 2, 6 and 7, while the other team hosts Games 3, 4 and 5.
When the Nationals beat the Astros last month, it marked the first time in World Series history that the home team lost all seven games.
On average, the home team actually wins about 54 percent of the time in baseball.
Running the numbers, you’ll quickly see that seven home losses is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

But putting seven aside for a moment, what’s the probability that the home team will lose at least six consecutive games?

*Extra credit*: What’s the probability the home team will lose at least five consecutive games? Four consecutive games?

## Classic

Five friends with a lot in common are playing the Riddler Lottery, in which each must choose exactly five numbers from 1 to 70.
After they all picked their numbers, the first friend notices that no number was selected by two or more friends.
Unimpressed, the second friend observes that all 25 selected numbers are composite (i.e., not prime).
Not to be outdone, the third friend points out that each selected number has at least two distinct prime factors.
After some more thinking, the fourth friend excitedly remarks that the product of selected numbers on each ticket is exactly the same.
At this point, the fifth friend is left speechless.
(You can tell why all these people are friends.)

What is the product of the selected numbers on each ticket?

*Extra credit*: How many *different* ways could the friends have selected five numbers each so that all their statements are true?
