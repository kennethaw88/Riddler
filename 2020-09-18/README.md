#Can You Break A Very Expensive Centrifuge? (18 September 2020)

## Express

Quoc's lab has a microcentrifuge, a piece of equipment that can separate components of a liquid by spinning around very rapidly.
Liquid samples are pipetted into small tubes, which are then placed in one of the microcentrifuge's 12 slots evenly spaced in a circle.

For the microcentrifuge to work properly, each tube must hold the same amount of liquid.
Also, importantly, the center of mass of the samples must be at the very center of the circle—otherwise, the microcentrifuge will not be balanced and may break.

Quoc notices that there is no way to place exactly one tube in the microcentrifuge so that it will be balanced, but he can place two tubes (e.g., in slots 1 and 7).

Now Quoc needs to spin exactly seven samples.
In which slots (numbered 1 through 12, as in the diagram above) should he place them so that the centrifuge will be balanced?

*Extra credit*: Assuming the 12 slots are distinct, how many different balanced arrangements of seven samples are there?

## Classic

One of Ollie's favorite online games is Guess My Word.
Each day, there is a secret word, and you try to guess it as efficiently as possible by typing in other words.
After each guess, you are told whether the secret word is alphabetically before or after your guess.
The game stops and congratulates you when you have guessed the secret word.
For example, the secret word was recently “nuance,” which Ollie arrived at with the following series of nine guesses: naan, vacuum, rabbi, papa, oasis, nuclear, nix, noxious, nuance.

Each secret word is randomly chosen from a dictionary with exactly 267,751 entries.
If you have this dictionary memorized, and play the game as efficiently as possible, how many guesses should you expect to make to guess the secret word?
