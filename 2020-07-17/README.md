## Express

This year, Major League Baseball announced it will play a shortened 60-game season, as opposed to the typical 162-game season.
Baseball is a sport of numbers and statistics, and so Taylor wondered about the impact of the season's length on some famous baseball records.

Some statistics are more achievable than others in a shortened season.
Suppose your true batting average is .350, meaning you have a 35 percent chance of getting a hit with every at-bat.
If you have four at-bats per game, what are your chances of batting at least .400 over the course of the 60-game season?
And how does this compare to your chances of batting at least .400 over the course of a 162-game season?

*Extra credit*: Some statistics are *less* achievable in a shortened season.
What are your chances of getting a hit in at least 56 consecutive games, tying or breaking Joe DiMaggio's record, in a 60-game season?
And how does this compare to your chances in a 162-game season?
(Again, suppose your true batting average is .350 and you have four at-bats per game.)

*Extra extra credit*: In a 60-game season, what are your chances of *both* batting at least .400 and getting a hit in at least 56 consecutive games?

## Classic

The tortoise and the hare are about to begin a 10-mile race along a “stretch” of road.
The tortoise is driving a car that travels 60 miles per hour, while the hare is driving a car that travels 75 miles per hour.
(For the purposes of this problem, assume that both cars accelerate from 0 miles per hour to their cruising speed instantaneously.)

The hare does a quick mental calculation and realizes if it waits until two minutes have passed, they'll cross the finish line at the exact same moment.
And so, when the race begins, the tortoise drives off while the hare patiently waits.

But one minute into the race, after the tortoise has driven 1 mile, something extraordinary happens.
The road turns out to be magical and instantaneously stretches by 10 miles!
As a result of this stretching, the tortoise is now 2 miles ahead of the hare, who remains at the starting line.

At the end of every subsequent minute, the road stretches by 10 miles.
With this in mind, the hare does some more mental math.

How long after the race has begun should the hare wait so that both the tortoise and the hare will cross the finish line at the same exact moment?
