# Can You Cut The Perfect Pancake? (23 April 2021)

## Express

After you intended to make a perfectly circular pancake, the batter has spread out, filling every last corner of your square pan.
(It is unclear why you were using a square pan in the first place.)

To salvage your breakfast, you plan to slice off the corners of your square pancake, giving you something closer to a circle.
The image below shows one such slice you might make.
Each slice must be straight, and no slice can pass through the inscribed blue circle that represents your original desired pancake.

Of course, there's a catch.
You can make at most five slices. If the blue circle has a radius of 1 unit, what is the minimum possible area your pancake can have after five slices?

## Classic

Riddler Nation's neighbor to the west, Enigmerica, is holding an election between two candidates, A and B.
Assume every person in Enigmerica votes randomly and independently, and that the number of voters is very, very large.
Moreover, due to health precautions, 20 percent of the population decides to vote early by mail.

On election night, the results of the 80 percent who voted on Election Day are reported out.
Over the next several days, the remaining 20 percent of the votes are then tallied.

What is the probability that the candidate who had fewer votes tallied on election night ultimately wins the race?
