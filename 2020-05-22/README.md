# Can You Find The Fish In State Names? (22 May 2020)

## Express

To share a cylindrical muffin equally with his two toddlers, Robert makes three vertical cuts in a "Y" pattern, producing three equal pieces.

The next morning, his wife wants in on the fun.
But before he can cut the muffin into quarters with an "X" pattern, one of his children suggests using an "A" pattern.
If Robert were to produce equal fourths in this manner, what would be the ratio of length of the A's middle bar to the radius of the muffin?

## Classic

Ohio is the only state whose name doesn't share any letters with the word "mackerel."
It's strange, but it’s true.

But that isn’t the only pairing of a state and a word you can say that about—it’s not even the only fish!
Kentucky has "goldfish" to itself, Montana has "jellyfish" and Delaware has "monkfish," just to name a few.

What is the longest "mackerel?"
That is, what is the longest word that doesn't share any letters with exactly one state?
(If multiple "mackerels" are tied for being the longest, can you find them all?)

*Extra credit*: Which state has the most "mackerels?"
That is, which state has the most words for which it is the only state without any letters in common with those words?
