## Express

You have three coins in your pocket, each of which can be a penny, nickel, dime or quarter with equal probability.
You might have three different coins, three of the same coin or two coins that are the same and one that is different.

Each of these coins can buy you a string whose length in centimeters equals the value of the coin in cents, i.e., the penny buys 1 cm of string, the nickel buys 5 cm of string, etc.
After purchasing your three lengths of string, what is the probability that they can be the side lengths of a triangle?

On Feb. 23, baseball statistician Jim Passon tweeted out some recent stats for baseball's God of WAR, Mike Trout:

Yes, Trout's numbers are gaudy.
But what caught social media's attention was that each stat (batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage and OPS) *somehow* had a corresponding number of games over which Trout averaged those stats.
For example, Trout batted .299 over his last 299 games.
Could this possibly be a coincidence?

If you think about it for a minute, you'll realize that there's nothing magical at all about having a batting average that matches a corresponding number of games.

Suppose a baseball player has four at-bats per game (not including walks), so their batting average is the number of hits they got divided by four times the number of games they played.
For many games, it's possible to have a corresponding batting average that, when rounded to three digits, equals the number of games divided by 1,000.
For example, if a player typically gets one hit per game in their at-bats, then they could very well have a .250 average over 250 games.

What is the greatest number of games for which it is *not* possible to have a matching rounded batting average?
Again, assume four at-bats per game.
