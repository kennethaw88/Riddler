# Can You Connect The Dots? (26 June 2020)

## Express

In Riddler City, the city streets follow a grid layout, running north-south and east-west.
You're driving north when you decide to play a little game.
Every time you reach an intersection, you randomly turn left or right, each with a 50 percent chance.

After driving through 10 intersections, what is the probability that you are still driving north?

*Extra credit*: Now suppose that at every intersection, there's a one-third chance you turn left, a one-third chance you turn right and a one-third chance you drive straight.
After driving through 10 intersections, *now* what's the probability that you are still driving north?

## Classic

Polly Gawn loves to play “connect the dots.”
Today, she's playing a particularly challenging version of the game, which has six unlabeled dots on the page.
She would like to connect them so that they form the vertices of a hexagon.
To her surprise, she finds that there are many different hexagons she can draw, each with the same six vertices.

What is the *greatest* possible number of unique hexagons Polly can draw using six points?

(*Hint*: With four points, that answer is three.
That is, Polly can draw up to three quadrilaterals, as long as one of the points lies inside the triangle formed by the other three.
Otherwise, Polly would only be able to draw one quadrilateral.)

*Extra Credit*: What is the greatest possible number of unique heptagons Polly can draw using seven points?
