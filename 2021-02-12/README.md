## Express

It's the second week in our four weeks of CrossProduct™ puzzles!

This time around, there are *six* three-digit numbers—each belongs in a row of the table below, with one digit per cell.
The products of the three digits of each number are shown in the rightmost column.
Meanwhile, the products of the digits in the hundreds, tens and ones places, respectively, are shown in the bottom row.

Can you find all six three-digit numbers and complete the table?

## Classic

James likes to draw doodles in the shapes of different polygons.
He especially likes to doodle *self-intersecting* polygons, where the sides cross over each other.
(These are distinct from the simple polygons you might have learned about in school, whose sides do not intersect each other.)

The other day, James was able to draw a self-intersecting polygon, each of whose sides intersected with exactly two other sides.
Not only that, he drew a polygon with the fewest possible sides that met these criteria.

What was it, you ask? It was a pentagram, which has just five sides.

Lovely.
But this got James really thinking—can you draw a polygon where each side intersects exactly *three* other sides?
And if so, what is the minimum number of sides this polygon can have?
