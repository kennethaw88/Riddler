# How Long Is The Snail’s Slimy Trail?  (1 November 2019)

## Express

Six snails are situated at the corners of a regular hexagon whose sides are all 10 meters.
Each snail is determined to reach its clockwise neighbor, and they all travel at the same speed.
But keep in mind that as each snail moves along, slowly but surely, the snail it’s traveling toward is *also* moving toward another snail.

The result is six snails — and six trails of slime — that spiral inward toward the center of the hexagon, as shown in the animation below:

How long is each snail’s slimy trail?

## Classic

The sultan has asked her vizier to present her with 10 candidates for marriage.
The vizier has searched the kingdom for the 10 most desirable partners, but he does not know whom the sultan will prefer.
If she saw them all at the same time, she would easily be able to rank them from 1 (the best partner) to 10 (the worst partner).
But the vizier can only present the candidates one at a time — very hard to sync everybody’s calendars, even back then — and in a random order.
Upon seeing each candidate, the sultan must reject or accept him.
If a candidate is rejected, the sultan cannot pick him again.
But on seeing each new candidate, she knows exactly where he’d stack up relative to the candidates she has rejected.
If she strategizes, what’s the highest rank she can expect her chosen candidate to have on average?

For example, if she simply accepted the first candidate presented to her, his rank could be anywhere from 1 to 10 with equal probability, averaging to 5.5.
Surely she can do better…
