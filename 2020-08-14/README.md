# Are You Hip Enough To Be Square? (14 August 2020)

## Express

You have a large pile of squares that each have a side length of 1 inch.
One square is blue, while all the other squares are white.
You want to arrange several white squares so they cover part of the blue square but don't overlap with each other.

For example, here's how you could arrange four white squares so they each cover part of the blue square.

What is the greatest number of white squares you can place so that each covers part of the blue square without overlapping one another?
(The entire blue square does not have to be covered, while the blue area that each white square covers must be nonzero.)

## Classic

The Riddler Manufacturing Company makes all sorts of mathematical tools: compasses, protractors, slide rules—you name it!

Recently, there was an issue with the production of foot-long rulers.
It seems that each ruler was accidentally sliced at three random points along the ruler, resulting in four pieces.
Looking on the bright side, that means there are now four times as many rulers—they just happen to have different lengths.

On average, how long are the pieces that contain the 6-inch mark?
