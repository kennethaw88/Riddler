#Can You Flip The Magic Coin? (19 June 2020)

## Express

I have a coin with a sun on the front and a moon on the back.
I claim that on most days, it's a fair coin, with a 50 percent chance of landing on either the sun or the moon.

But once a year, on the summer solstice, the coin absorbs the sun's rays and exhibits a strange power: It always comes up the opposite side as the previous flip.

Of course, you are skeptical of my claim.
You figure there's a 1 percent chance that the coin is magical and a 99 percent chance that it's just an ordinary fair coin.
You then ask me to “prove” the coin is magical by flipping it some number of times.

How many successfully alternating coin flips will it take for you to think there's a 99 percent chance the coin is magical (or, more likely, that I've rigged it in some way so it always alternates)?

## Classic

King Auric adored his most prized possession: a set of perfect spheres of solid gold.
There was one of each size, with diameters of 1 centimeter, 2 centimeters, 3 centimeters, and so on.
Their brilliant beauty brought joy to his heart.
After many years, he felt the time had finally come to pass the golden spheres down to the next generation—his three children.

He decided it was best to give each child precisely one-third of the total gold by weight, but he had a difficult time determining just how to do that.
After some trial and error, he managed to divide his spheres into three groups of equal weight.
He was further amused when he realized that his collection contained the *minimum* number of spheres needed for this division.
How many golden spheres did King Auric have?

*Extra credit*: How many spheres would the king have needed to be able to divide his collection among other numbers of children: two, four, five, six or even more?
