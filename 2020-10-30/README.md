# Beware The Hot Pumpkin (30 October 2020)

## Express

While waiting in line to vote early last week, I overheard a discussion between election officials.
Apparently, there may have been a political sign that was within 100 feet of the polling place, against New York State law.

This got me thinking.
Suppose a polling site is a square building whose sides are 100 feet in length.
An election official takes a string that is also 100 feet long and ties one end to a door located in the middle of one of the building's sides.
She then holds the other end of the string in her hand.

What's the area of the region outside of the building she can reach while holding the string?

## Classic

Instead of playing hot potato, you and 60 of your closest friends decide to play a socially distanced game of hot pumpkin.

Before the game starts, you all sit in a circle and agree on a positive integer *N*.
Once the number has been chosen, you (the leader of the group) start the game by counting “1” and passing the pumpkin to the person sitting directly to your left.
She then declares “2” and passes the pumpkin one space to *her* left.
This continues with each player saying the next number in the sequence, wrapping around the circle as many times as necessary, until the group has collectively counted up to *N*.
At that point, the player who counted “*N*” is eliminated, and the player directly to his or her left starts the next round, again proceeding to the same value of *N*.
The game continues until just one player remains, who is declared the victor.

In the game's first round, the player 18 spaces to your left is the first to be eliminated.
Ricky, the next player in the sequence, begins the next round.
The second round sees the elimination of the player 31 spaces to Ricky's left.
Zach begins the third round, only to find himself eliminated in a cruel twist of fate.
(Woe is Zach.)

What was the smallest value of *N* the group could have used for this game?

*Extra credit*: Suppose the players were numbered from 1 to 61, with you as Player No. 1, the player to your left as Player No. 2 and so on.
Which player won the game?

*Extra extra credit*: What's the smallest *N* that would have made *you* the winner?
