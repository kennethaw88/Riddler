\section*{Riddle:}

While waiting in line to vote early last week, I overheard a discussion between election officials.
Apparently, there may have been a political sign that was within 100~feet of the polling place, against New York State law.

This got me thinking.
Suppose a polling site is a square building whose sides are 100 feet in length.
An election official takes a string that is also 100 feet long and ties one end to a door located in the middle of one of the buildingâ€™s sides.
She then holds the other end of the string in her hand.

What's the area of the region outside of the building she can reach while holding the string?

\section*{Solution:}

The path traced out by the end of the string is a circular arc.
When the string hits the edge of the building, it continues in a smaller arc along the sides of the building.
The shape is shown below:

The region traced out by the string forms a semicircle and two quarter circles.
The radius of the large semicircle is of course 100~ft, and the radius of the quarter circles is 50~ft.
So the area $A$ is

\[
A=\frac{1}{2}\pi 100^2+2\frac{1}{4}\pi 50^2
\]

The solution is therefore (approximately)
\fcolorbox{red}{white}{\bf 19,635~sq~ft}\,.
