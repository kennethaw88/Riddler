Can You Roll The Perfect Bowl? (31 January 2020)

## Express

At the recent World Indoor Bowls Championships in Great Yarmouth, England, one of the rolls by Nick Brett went viral.
Here it is in all its glory:

In order for Nick’s green bowl to split the two red bowls, he needed expert precision in both the speed of the roll and its final angle of approach.

Suppose you were standing in Nick’s shoes, and you wanted to split two of your opponent’s bowls.
Let’s simplify the math a little, and say that each bowl is a sphere with a radius of 1.
Let’s further suppose that your opponent’s two red bowls are separated by a distance of 3 — that is, the centers of the red bowls are separated by a distance of 5.
Define *ɸ* as the angle between the path your bowl is on and the line connecting your opponent’s bowls.

For example, here’s how you could split your opponent’s bowls when *ɸ* is 75 degrees:

What is the *minimum* value of *ɸ* that will allow your bowl to split your opponents’ bowls without hitting them?

## Classic

Robert’s daughter has a set of Magna-Tiles, which, as their name implies, are tiles with magnets on the edges that can be used to build various polygons and polyhedra.
Some of the tiles are identical isosceles triangles with one 30 degree angle and two 75 degree angles.
If you were to arrange 12 of these tiles with their 30 degree angles in the center, they would lay flat and form a regular dodecagon.
If you were to put fewer (between three and 11) of those tiles together in a similar way, they would form a pyramid whose base is a regular polygon.
Robert has graciously provided a photo of the resulting pyramids when three and 11 tiles are used:

If Robert wanted to maximize the volume contained within the resulting pyramid (presumably to store as much candy for his daughter as possible), how many tiles should he use?
