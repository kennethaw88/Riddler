# Can You Crack The Case Of The Crescent Moon? (16 April 2021)

## Express

You are creating a variation of a Romulan pixmit deck.
Each card is an equilateral triangle, with one of the digits 0 through 9 (written in Romulan, of course) at the base of each side of the card.
No number appears more than once on each card.
Furthermore, every card in the deck is unique, meaning no card can be rotated so that it matches (i.e., can be superimposed on) any other card.

What is the greatest number of cards your pixmit deck can have?

*Extra credit*: Suppose you allow numbers to appear two or three times on a given card.
Once again, no card can be rotated so that it matches any other card.
Now what is the greatest number of cards your pixmit deck can have?

## Classic

After a new moon, the crescent appears to grow slowly at first.
At some point, the moon will be one-sixth full by area, then one-quarter full, and so on.
Eventually, it becomes a half-moon, at which point its growth begins to slow down.
The animation below provides some insight into what's happening here:

How many times faster is the area of the illuminated moon growing when it is a half-moon versus a one-sixth moon?

(Some simplifying assumptions you might make for this problem are that the moon is a perfect sphere, that its orbit around Earth is a perfect circle, that the moon orbits the Earth much faster than the Earth orbits the sun and that the sun is very, very far away.
If you make additional assumptions, feel free to include them in your response.)
