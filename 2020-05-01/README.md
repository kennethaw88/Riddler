## Express

[Dakota Jones](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-help-dakota-jones-raid-the-lost-arc) is back in action.
In her quest to locate the Temple of Diametra, she has found another highly symmetric crystal.
However, nefarious agents have again gotten wind of her plans, and now Dakota and the crystal are nowhere to be found.

And so, you must once again recreate the crystal using the data from Dakota’s laser scanner.
As a reminder, the scanner takes a 3D object and records 2D cross-sectional slices along the third dimension.
Here’s the looping animation file the scanner produced for the crystal *this* time:

What sort of three-dimensional shape is the crystal?
No pressure—Dakota Jones, nay, the entire world, is counting on you to locate the lost temple!

## Classic

You are locked in the dungeon of a faraway castle with three fellow prisoners (i.e., there are four prisoners in total), each in a separate cell with no means of communication.
But it just so happens that all of you are logicians (of course).

To entertain themselves, the guards have decided to give you all a single chance for immediate release.
Each prisoner will be given a fair coin, which can either be fairly flipped one time or returned to the guards without being flipped.
If all flipped coins come up heads, you will all be set free!
But if any of the flipped coins comes up tails, or if no one chooses to flip a coin, you will all be doomed to spend the rest of your lives in the castle's dungeon.

The only tools you and your fellow prisoners have to aid you are random number generators, which will give each prisoner a random number, uniformly and independently chosen between zero and one.

What are your chances of being released?

*Extra credit*: Instead of four prisoners, suppose there are N prisoners. Now what are your chances of being released?
