# Are You Smarter Than A Fourth-Grader? (14 May 2021)

## Express

You and your infinitely many friends are sharing a cake, and you come up with two rather bizarre ways of splitting it.

For the first method, Friend 1 takes half of the cake, Friend 2 takes a third of *what remains*, Friend 3 takes a quarter of what remains after Friend 2, Friend 4 takes a fifth of what remains after Friend 3, and so on.
After your infinitely many friends take their respective pieces, you get whatever is left.

For the second method, your friends decide to save you a little more of the take.
This time around, Friend 1 takes 1/2<sup>2</sup> (or one-quarter) of the cake, Friend 2 takes 1/3<sup>2</sup> (or one-ninth) of *what remains*, Friend 3 takes 1/4<sup>2</sup> of what remains after Friend 3, and so on.
Again, after your infinitely many friends take their respective pieces, you get whatever is left.

Question 1: How much of the cake do you get using the first method?

Question 2: How much of the cake do you get using the second method?

*Extra credit*: Your friends are feeling rather guilty for not saving enough of the cake for you, so they try one more method.
This time, they only take the fractions with even denominators from the second method.
So Friend 1 takes 1/2<sup>2</sup> of the cake, Friend 2 takes 1/4<sup>2</sup> of what remains, Friend 3 takes 1/6<sup>2</sup> of what remains after Friend 2, and so on.
After your infinitely many friends take their respective pieces, how much of the cake do you get?

## Classic

From Matt Yeager comes a game that is immensely popular with his fourth-grade class:

Three of Matt's students—Players A, B and C—are engaged in a game of *veinte*.
In each round, players take turns saying numbers in order (Player A, then B, then C, then A again, etc.).
The first player to go says the number “1.”
Each number must be either one, two, three or four more than the number said by the previous player.
When someone says “20,” the round is over and the next person is eliminated, with the following person beginning the subsequent round.
For example, if Player A says “20,” then Player B is eliminated, while Player C begins the next round by saying “1.”
At no point can anyone say a number greater than 20.

All three players want to be the winner (i.e., the only player remaining) after the two rounds.
But if they realize they can't win, then they will prioritize making it to the second round.

Player A starts things off by saying “1.”
Which player will win?

*Extra credit*: Instead of three players, now suppose there are four—Players A, B, C and D—all of whom want to make it through as many rounds of the game as possible.
Again, Player A starts things off by saying “1.”
Which player will win?
