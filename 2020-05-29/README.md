# Can You Join the World's Biggest Zoom Call? (29 May 2020)

## Express

While spending more time at home in recent weeks, I've had the chance to revisit one of my favorite video games from recent years — The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
Within the game, there are hundreds of hidden “Korok Seeds,” which I'm having an increasingly difficult time finding.

Fortunately, there's a special mask you can acquire in the game that makes a sound any time you're within a certain distance of a Korok Seed.
While playing, I marked nine distinct locations on the game map, forming the 3-by-3 grid shown below:

Each leaf symbol is within range of a Korok Seed, while the point in the middle is *not* within range of a Korok Seed.
Given this arrangement, what is the minimum possible number of Korok Seeds I could have detected?

## Classic

One Friday morning, suppose everyone in the U.S. (about 330 million people) joins a single Zoom meeting between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.—to discuss the latest Riddler column, of course.
This being a virtual meeting, many people will join late and leave early.

In fact, the attendees all follow the same steps in determining when to join and leave the meeting.
Each person independently picks two random times between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.—not rounded to the nearest minute, mind you, but *any* time within that range.
They then join the meeting at the earlier time and leave the meeting at the later time.

What is the probability that at least one attendee is on the call with everyone else (i.e., the attendee's time on the call overlaps with every other person's time on the call)?

*Extra credit*: What is the probability that at least *two* attendees are on the call with everyone else?
