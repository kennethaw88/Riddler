## Express

Every year, CJ's family of five (including CJ) does a book exchange for Christmas.
First, each person puts their name in a hat.
The hat is shaken, and then each person draws a random name from the hat and gifts that person a book.
However, if anyone draws their own name, they all put their names back into the hat and start over.

What is the probability that no one will draw their own name?

## Classic

Three friends are baking holiday cookies together.
They have a flat layer of cookie dough in the shape of an isosceles right triangle (shown below).
They want to design a cookie cutter that will cut out three identical (i.e., congruent) cookies.
The cookies should be as large as possible while staying within the triangle and without overlapping each other.

Had there been two friends or four friends, they would have been able to use all of the cookie dough.
But with three friends, there will unfortunately be some cookie dough that goes to waste.

What is the greatest percentage of cookie dough that can be made up by the three identical cookies?
When explaining your work, please be as detailed as you can about the arrangement of your cookies so I can verify your work!

*Extra credit*: Instead of a right isosceles triangle, the three friends now want to make identical cookies from a sphinx of cookie dough.
Again, what is the greatest percentage of cookie dough that can go into the three identical cookies?
