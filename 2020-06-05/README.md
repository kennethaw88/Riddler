Can You Pinpoint The Planet?  (5 June 2020)

## Express

The astronomers on planet Xiddler have made several remarkable discoveries.
After inventing the telescope, they quickly discovered a new planet in their solar system!

Xiddler is very much like Earth.
The planet orbits its star in a nearly circular path, with an average distance of 150 million kilometers, a period of one Earth year and a day that lasts 24 hours.
But *unlike* Earth, there weren't any other known planets in the solar system…until now.

Moments after the Xiddlerian sun set below the horizon, three astronomers happened to focus their telescopes at the zenith of the evening sky, all seeing the same new planet.
In their excitement, the astronomers race to Xiddler's Grand Minister to deliver the momentous news.

The first astronomer says that, by her calculations, the newly discovered planet orbits their sun with a radius of 50 million kilometers.
The second astronomer says that, by her calculations, the planet in fact orbits their sun with a radius of 300 million kilometers.
The third astronomer disagrees with the other two—by her calculations, the planet has a very similar orbit to Xiddler, with a radius of 150 million kilometers.

Which astronomer should the Grand Minister believe?

## Classic

Some friends have invited you to a protest, and you'll be making a sign with large lettering.
You're filling in the sign's letters by drawing horizontal lines with a marker.
The marker has a flat circular tip with a radius of 1 centimeter, and you're holding the marker so that it's upright, perpendicular to the sign.

Since the diameter of the marker's tip is 2 centimeters, you decide to fill in the letters by drawing lines every 2 centimeters.
However, this is the pattern you get:

The shading doesn't look very uniform—each stroke is indeed 2 centimeters wide, but there appear to be gaps between the strokes.
Of course, if you drew many, many lines all bunched together, you'd have a rather uniform shading.

But you don't have all day to make this sign.
If the lines can't overlap by more than 1 centimeter—half the diameter of the marker tip—what should this overlap be, in order to achieve a shading that's as uniform as possible?
And how uniform will this shading be, say, as measured by the standard deviation in relative ink on the sign?
