Riddler Nation's Jibriel Taha, an avid baseball fan, saw the following tweet from the Milwaukee Brewers' beat writer Adam McCalvy:

>The Brewers are...

>    5-5 last 10g
>10-10 last 20g
>15-15 last 30g
>20-20 last 40g
>25-25 last 50g
>30-30 last 60g

Inspired by the Brewers' apparent mediocrity (they've since gone on a roll to clinch a playoff spot) Jibriel asks the following:

If a baseball team is truly .500, meaning it has a 50 percent chance of winning each game, what's the probability that it has won two of its last four games and four of its last eight games?


## Classic

Riddler League Baseball, also known as the RLB, consists of three teams: the Mississippi Moonwalkers, the Delaware Doubloons and the Tennessee Taters.

Each time a batter for the Moonwalkers comes to the plate, they have a 40 percent chance of getting a walk and a 60 percent chance of striking out. Each batter for the Doubloons, meanwhile, hits a double 20 percent percent of the time, driving in any teammates who are on base, and strikes out the remaining 80 percent of the time. Finally, each batter for the Taters has a 10 percent chance of hitting a home run and a 90 percent chance of striking out.

During the RLB season, each team plays an equal number of games against each opponent. Games are nine innings long and can go into extra innings just like in other baseball leagues. Which of the three teams is most likely to have the best record at the end of the season?
