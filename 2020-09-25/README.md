#Can You Save Some Cold Pizza? (18 September 2020)

## Express

The U.S. Open concluded last weekend, with physics major Bryson DeChambeau emerging victorious.
Seeing his favorite golfer win his first major got Dan thinking about the precision needed to be a professional at the sport.

A typical hole is about 400 yards long, while the cup measures a mere 4.25 inches in diameter.
Suppose that, with every swing, you hit the ball X percent closer to the center of the hole.
For example, if *X* were 75 percent, then with every swing the ball would be four times closer to the hole than it was previously.

For a 400-yard hole, assuming there are no hazards (water, sand or otherwise) in the way, what is the minimum value of *X* so that you'll shoot par, meaning you'll hit the ball into the cup in exactly four strokes?

## Classic

Dean ordered a personal pizza that was precisely 10 inches in diameter.
He ate half of it, and he wants to save the remaining semicircle of pizza in his refrigerator. He has circular plates of all different sizes, so to save space in his fridge, he'll place the pizza on the smallest plate that holds the entire semicircle (i.e., with no pizza hanging off the plate).

Unfortunately, the smallest plate that can hold half of a 10-inch pizza is just a circle with a 10-inch diameter. So much for saving space.

But Dean has a thought: If he *cuts* the pizza, he can squeeze both of the resulting pieces onto a smaller circular plateâ€”again, with no pizza hanging off the plate and without the pieces lying on top of each other.

If Dean makes a single straight slice, what is the diameter of the *smallest* circular plate onto which he can fit the two resulting pieces?

*Extra credit*: Dean wants to save even more space in his fridge.
So instead of one straight slice, he will now make *two* straight slices.
First, he will cut the semicircular pizza into two pieces.
Then, he will take one of those pieces and make his second slice, giving him a total of three pieces.
What is the diameter of the smallest circular plate onto which he can fit all three pieces?
