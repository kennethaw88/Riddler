# Can You Crack The Case Of The Crystal Key? (28 May 2021)

## Express

As of this week, there have already been six no-hitters this MLB season, well on pace to break the record for no-hitters for a season in the modern era, which stands at nine in 1990.

To achieve a no-hitter, a pitcher must pitch a complete game (recording 27 outs over nine innings) without allowing a hit (i.e., walks and other means of reaching base are allowed).
However, to achieve a *perfect game*, a pitcher must record 27 consecutive outs without allowing anyone from the opposing team on base.
There have been only 23 perfect games in MLB history. Two were thrown in 2010, and three were thrown in 2012.

In 2009, the leaguewide on-base percentage was 0.333.
That figure has fallen over the past decade, and this year, it's all the way down to 0.313, which helps explain the surge in no-hitters.

How low would a batter's chances of reaching base have to be for you to expect one perfect game per season?
(You can make the following simplifying assumptions: All batters have the same chances of reaching base; at-bats are independent from each other; there are 30 MLB teams, and each club plays 162 games; and no games go into extra innings.)

## Classic

Dakota Jones is back in action!
To gain access to a hidden temple deep in the Riddlerian Jungle, she needs a crystal key.

She already knows the crystal is a polyhedron.
And according to an ancient text, it has exactly six edges, five of which are 1 inch long.
Cryptically, the text does not specify the length of the sixth edge.
Instead, it says that the key is the largest such polyhedron (i.e., with six edges, five of which have length 1) by volume.

Once again, Dakota Jones needs your help.
What is the volume of the crystal key?
