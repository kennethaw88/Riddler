# How High Can You Count With Menorah Math?  (11 December 2020)

## Express

Yesterday was the first night of Hanukkah, which means millions of Jews began lighting their menorahs.
It is traditional to start with one candle in the rightmost position, which is lit using a central candle called a shamash.
On the second night, a second candle is added to the left of the first.
On the third night, a third candle is added to the left of the second, and so on, until all eight candles have been added on the final night.

With this system for adding candles, whether you are looking at the menorah from the front (i.e., in your home) or back (i.e., through a window), you can easily determine which of the eight nights of Hanukkah it is by counting the number of candles (other than the shamash).
But what if you wanted to make that same menorah capable of tracking *more* than eight nights?

To do that, you'd have to devise a new system of adding or moving candles (other than the shamash in the middle, which is always lit) around the menorah so that it can uniquely indicate as many nights as possible.
Your system must read the same forward and backward, so that regardless of whether you're looking at the menorah from the front or the back you will still know what night it is.
What is the greatest number of nights that could be indicated using your system?

## Classic

The Potentate of Puzzles decides to give five unlucky citizens a test.
The potentate has countless red hats, green hats and blue hats.
She says to the citizens, “Tomorrow, you will all be blindfolded as I place one of these hats on each of your heads.
Once all the hats are placed, your blindfolds will be removed.
At this point, there will be no communication between any of you!
As soon as I give a signal, everyone must guess—at the same time—the color of the hat atop their own head.
If *at least one* of you guesses correctly, all of you will survive!
Otherwise …”

The potentate continues: “The good news is that there's a little more information you'll have.
I will be arranging you into two rows facing each other, with two of you in one row and three of you in the other.
Citizens in the same row cannot see each other, but they can see all the citizens in the other row.
Finally, each citizen will know their placement *within* their own row—that is, whether they are seated on the left or right or in the middle.”

Can the citizens devise a strategy beforehand that ensures their survival?
If so, what is the strategy?
