## Express

This week, Riddler Nation needs your help designing its new credit card, appropriately named Riddler Express<sup>TM</sup>—don't solve puzzles without it!

The logo consists of two overlapping circles with radius 1 inch, creating three distinct regions: one region that's shared between the two circles, and two regions that are part of one circle, but not the other.

Because the Riddler Express<sup>TM</sup> card is for the mathematically inclined, its parent company has issued a corporate mandate regarding symmetry.
In particular, the areas of all three regions must be exactly the same.
If that's the case, how far apart must the centers of the two circles be?

**Extra Credit**: If you symmetrically arrange three circles of radius 1, you have seven distinct regions.
How far apart should the centers of the circles be such that the areas of the largest and smallest of the seven regions are as close to equivalent as possible?


## Classic

You are the coach for Team Riddler at the Tour de FiveThirtyEight, where there are 20 teams (including yours).
Your objective is to win the Team Time Trial race, which has the following rules:

* Each team rides as a group throughout the course at some fixed pace, specified by that team's coach. Teams that can't maintain their pace are said to have “cracked,” and don't finish the course.
* The team that finishes the course with the fastest pace is declared the winner.
* Teams ride the course one at a time. After each team completes its attempt, the next team quickly consults with its coach (who assigns a pace) and then begins its ride. Coaches are aware of the results of all previous teams when choosing their own team's pace.

Assume that all teams are of equal ability: At any given pace, they have the exact same probability of cracking, and the faster the pace, the greater the probability of cracking.
Teams' chances of cracking are independent, and each team's coach knows exactly what a team's chances of cracking are for each pace.

Team Riddler is the first team to attempt the course.
To maximize your chances of winning, what's the probability that your team will finish the course?
What's the probability you'll ultimately win?

**Extra Credit**: If Team Riddler is the last team to attempt the course (rather than the first), what are its chances of victory?
