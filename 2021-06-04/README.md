# Can You Decipher The Secret Message? (4 June 2021)

## Express

Max the Mathemagician is calling for volunteers.
He has a magic wand of length 10 that can be broken anywhere along its length (fractional and decimal lengths are allowed).
After the volunteer chooses these breakpoints, Max will multiply the lengths of the resulting pieces.
For example, if they break the wand near its midpoint and nowhere else, the resulting product is 5×5, or 25.
If the product is the largest possible, they will win a free backstage pass to his next show.
(Amazing, right?)

You raise your hand to volunteer, and you and Max briefly make eye contact.
As he calls you up to the stage, you know you have this in the bag.
What is the maximum product you can achieve?

*Extra credit*: Zax the Mathemagician (no relation to Max) has the same routine in his show, only the wand has a length of 100.
What is the maximum product now?

## Classic

This week's Classic comes courtesy of Alexander Zhang of Lynbrook High School, California.
Alexander won first place in the mathematics category at this year's International Science and Engineering Fair for his work at the intersection of topology and medicine.
He developed his own highly efficient algorithms to detect and remove defects (like “handles” or “tunnels”) from three-dimensional scans (e.g., MRI).
Alexander has long had an interest in topology, which *just might* be related to his submitted puzzle.

Consider the following image showing a particular uppercase sans serif font:

Alexander thinks many of these letters are equivalent, but he leaves it to you to figure out how and why.
He also has a message for you:

It may not look like much, but Alexander assures me that it is equivalent to exactly one word in the English language.

What is Alexander's message?
