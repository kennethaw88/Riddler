## Express

As you sit down to pass the time with a sudoku puzzle, you immediately notice that the grid is oddly sparse—only a handful of numbers are initially filled in.
But it gets worse.
While there aren’t any numbers that occur more than once in the same row, column, or square (i.e., the grid doesn’t *ostensibly* break any of the sudoku rules), upon closer inspection, you can see that the puzzle is impossible.

What is the *smallest* possible sum of the initial numbers in the grid?
(Note that multiple instances of the same number count separately.
So if your impossible grid happened to consist of eight 4s and two 5s, the sum would be 42.)

## Classic

The fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons introduced a system of "advantage and disadvantage."
When you roll a die "with advantage," you roll the die twice and keep the higher result.
Rolling "with disadvantage" is similar, except you keep the lower result instead.
The rules further specify that when a player rolls with *both* advantage and disadvantage, they cancel out, and the player rolls a single die.
Yawn!

There are two other, more mathematically interesting ways that advantage and disadvantage could be combined.
First, you could have "advantage of disadvantage," meaning you roll twice with disadvantage and then keep the higher result.
Or, you could have "disadvantage of advantage," meaning you roll twice with advantage and then keep the lower result.
With a fair 20-sided die, which situation produces the highest expected roll: advantage of disadvantage, disadvantage of advantage or rolling a single die?

*Extra Credit*: Instead of maximizing your expected roll, suppose you need to roll *N* or better with your 20-sided die.
For each value of *N*, is it better to use advantage of disadvantage, disadvantage of advantage or rolling a single die?
