## Express

At long last, Dakota Jones is close to finding the Lost Arc, a geometric antiquity buried deep in the sands of Egypt.
Along the way, she discovered what she described as a “highly symmetric crystal” that's needed to precisely locate the Arc.
Dakota measured the crystal using her laser scanner and relayed the results to you.
But nefarious agents have gotten wind of her plans, and Dakota and the crystal are nowhere to be found.

Locating the Arc is now up to you.
To do that, you must recreate the crystal using the data from Dakota's laser scanner.
The scanner takes a 3D object, and records 2D cross-sectional slices along the third dimension.
Here's the looping animation file the scanner produced for the crystal:

What sort of three-dimensional shape is the crystal?
No pressure—Dakota Jones, nay, the entire world, is counting on you to locate the Lost Arc and ensure its place in a museum!


## Classic

Recent Riddlers have tackled Scrabble Superstrings and road trips through 48 states.
For this week's Riddler Classic, Max Maguire combines these two puzzles into one:

The challenge is to find the longest string of letters in which (1) every pair of consecutive letters is a two-letter state or territory abbreviation, and (2) no state abbreviation occurs more than once.
For example, Guam, Utah and Texas can be combined into the valid four-letter string GUTX.
Another valid string is ALAK (Alabama, Louisiana and Alaska), while ALAL (Alabama, Louisiana and Alabama) is invalid because it includes the same state, Alabama, twice.
