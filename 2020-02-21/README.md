## Express

On a warm, sunny day, Nick glanced at a thermometer, and noticed something quite interesting.
When he toggled between the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, the digits of the temperature—when rounded to the nearest degree—had switched.
For example, this works for a temperature of 61 degrees Fahrenheit, which corresponds to a temperature of 16 degrees Celsius.

However, the temperature that day was not 61 degrees Fahrenheit.
What was the temperature?

## Classic

You have two fair coins, labeled A and B.
When you flip coin A, you get 1 point if it comes up heads, but you lose 1 point if it comes up tails.
Coin B is worth twice as much—when you flip coin B, you get 2 points if it comes up heads, but you lose 2 points if it comes up tails.

To play the game, you make a total of 100 flips.
For each flip, you can choose either coin, and you know the outcomes of all the previous flips.
In order to win, you must finish with a positive total score.
In your eyes, finishing with 2 points is just as good as finishing with 200 points—any positive score is a win.
(By the same token, finishing with 0 or −2 points is just as bad as finishing with −200 points.)

If you optimize your strategy, what percentage of games will you win?
(Remember, one game consists of 100 coin flips.)

*Extra credit*: What if coin A isn’t fair (but coin B is still fair)?
That is, if coin A comes up heads with probability p and you optimize your strategy, what percentage of games will you win?
