## Express

You're reviewing some of the survey data that was randomly collected from the residents of Riddler City.
As you'll recall, the city is quite large.

Ten randomly selected residents were asked how many people (including them) lived in their household.
As it so happened, their answers were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.

It's your job to use this (admittedly limited) data to estimate the average household size in Riddler City.
Your co-worker suggests averaging the 10 numbers, which would give you an answer of about 5.5 people.
But you're not so sure.

Would your best estimate be exactly 5.5, less than 5.5 or greater than 5.5?

## Classic

Congratulations, you've made it to the finals of the Riddler Ski Federation's winter championship!
There's just one opponent left to beat, and then the gold medal will be yours.

Each of you will complete *two* runs down the mountain, and the times of your runs will be added together.
Whoever skis in the least overall time is the winner. Also, this being the *Riddler* Ski Federation, you have been presented detailed data on both you and your opponent.
You are evenly matched, and both have the same normal probability distribution of finishing times for each run.
And for both of you, your time on the first run is completely independent of your time on the second run.

For the first runs, your opponent goes first.
Then, it's your turn. As you cross the finish line, your coach excitedly signals to you that you were faster than your opponent.
Without knowing either exact time, what's the probability that you will still be ahead after the second run and earn your gold medal?

*Extra credit*: Over in the snowboarding championship, there are 30 finalists, including you (apparently, you're a dual-sport threat!).
Again, you are the last one to complete the first run, and your coach signals that you are in the lead.
What is the probability that you'll win gold in snowboarding?
