# Can You Eat All The Chocolates? (2 October 2020)

## Express

Benjamin likes numbers that can be written as the difference between two perfect squares. He thinks they're hip.
For example, the number 40 is hip, since it equals 7<sup>2</sup>−3<sup>2</sup>, or 49−9.
But hold the phone, 40 is *doubly* hip, because it also equals 11<sup>2</sup>−9<sup>2</sup>, or 121−81.

With apologies to Douglas Adams, 42 is not particularly hip.
Go ahead and try finding two perfect squares whose difference is 42. I'll wait.

Now, Benjamin is upping the stakes. He wants to know just how hip 1,400 might be.
Can you do him a favor, and figure out how many ways 1,400 can be written as the difference of two perfect squares?
Benjamin will really appreciate it.

*Extra credit*: Can you find a general formula or approach for counting the number of ways any whole number can be written as the difference between two perfect squares?
(Your approach might be a function of whether the number is even or odd, its prime factorization, etc.)

## Classic

I have 10 chocolates in a bag: two are milk chocolate, while the other eight are dark chocolate.
One at a time, I randomly pull chocolates from the bag and eat them—that is, until I pick a chocolate of the other kind.
When I get to the other type of chocolate, I put it back in the bag and start drawing again with the remaining chocolates.
I keep going until I have eaten all 10 chocolates.

For example, if I first pull out a dark chocolate, I will eat it.
(I'll always eat the first chocolate I pull out.)
If I pull out a second dark chocolate, I will eat that as well.
If the third one is milk chocolate, I will not eat it (yet), and instead place it back in the bag.
Then I will start again, eating the first chocolate I pull out.

What are the chances that the *last* chocolate I eat is milk chocolate?
