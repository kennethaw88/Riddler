#Is The Price Right? (16 October 2020)

## Express

On Nov. 3, the residents of Riddler City will elect a mayor from among three candidates.
The winner will be the candidate who receives an outright majority (i.e., more than 50 percent of the vote).
But if no one achieves this outright majority, there will be a runoff election among the top two candidates.

If the voting shares of each candidate are uniformly distributed between 0 percent and 100 percent (subject to the constraint that they add up to 100 percent, of course), then what is the probability of a runoff?

*Extra credit*: Suppose there are *N* candidates instead of three.
What is the probability of a runoff?

## Classic

This week, we return to the brilliant and ageless game show, “The Price is Right.”
In a modified version of the bidding round, you and two (not three) other contestants must guess the price of an item, one at a time.

Assume the true price of this item is a randomly selected value between 0 and 100.
(Note: The value is a real number and does not have to be an integer.)
Among the three contestants, the winner is whoever guesses the closest price *without going over*.
For example, if the true price is 29 and I guess 30, while another contestant guesses 20, then they would be the winner even though my guess was technically closer.

In the event all three guesses exceed the actual price, the contestant who made the lowest (and therefore closest) guess is declared the winner.
I mean, *someone* has to win, right?

If you are the first to guess, and all contestants play optimally (taking full advantage of the guesses of those who went before them), what are your chances of winning?
