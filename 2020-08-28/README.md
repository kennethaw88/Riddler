#Can You Cover The Globe? (28 August 2020)

## Express

Suppose you have a rope that goes all the way around the Earth's equator, flat on the ground.
(For the entirety of this puzzle, you should assume that the Earth is a perfect sphere with a radius of 6,378 kilometers.)

You want to lengthen the rope just the right amount so that it's 1 meter off the ground all the way around the Earth. How much longer did you have to make the rope?

If you've never heard this puzzle before, the answer is surprisingly small—about 6.28 (i.e., 2𝜋) meters.
Also, spoiler alert!
(Darn, I was one sentence too late.)

Now, instead of tying the Earth up with rope, you've moved on to covering the globe with a giant sheet that lies flat on the ground.
If you want the sheet to be 1 meter off the ground (just like the rope), by how much would you have to increase the area of your sheet?

*Extra credit*: What city, country, land mass or body of water has an area that is very close to your answer?

## Classic

Duane's friend's granddaughter claimed that she once won a game of War that lasted exactly 26 turns.

War is a two-player game in which a standard deck of cards is first shuffled and then divided into two piles with 26 cards each—one pile for each player.
In every turn of the game, both players flip over and reveal the top card of their deck.
The player whose card has a higher rank wins the turn and places both cards on the bottom of their pile.
In the event that both cards have the same rank, the rules get a little more complicated, with each player flipping over additional cards to compare in a mini “War” showdown.
Duane's friend's granddaughter said that for every turn of the game, she always drew the card of higher rank, with no mini “Wars.”

Assuming a deck is randomly shuffled before every game, how many games of War would you expect to play until you had a game that lasted just 26 turns with no “Wars,” like Duane's friend's granddaughter?
