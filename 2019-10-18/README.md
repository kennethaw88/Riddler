## Express

The number in each box tells you how many spaces up, down, left or right you must move. (No diagonal moves, people.)
Starting at the yellow six in the bottom left corner, can you make your way to the asterisk?

## Classic

Riddler Nation has two coins: the Dio, worth $538, and the Phantus, worth $19.
When visiting on vacation, Riddler National Bank will gladly convert your dollars into Dios and Phanti.
For example, if you were to give a bank teller $614, they’d return to you one Dio and four Phanti, since 614=1×538+4×19.
But if you tried to exchange one dollar more (i.e., $615), then alas, there is no combination of Dios and Phanti the teller could give you, and you won’t get your money’s worth in local currency.

To make the bank teller’s job (and your vacation) as miserable as possible, you decide to bring the largest dollar amount that cannot be converted into Riddler currency.
How much money are we talking here?
That is, what’s the largest whole number that *cannot* be expressed as a sum of 19s and 538s?

**Extra Credit**: Word is that Riddler Nation is considering minting a third currency, worth $101.
If they do, then what would be the largest dollar amount that cannot be converted into Riddler currency?
