# Can You Cheat At Rock, Paper, Scissors? (31 July 2020)

## Express

The rules are simple: Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
Moreover, the game is “sudden death,” so the first person to win a single round is immediately declared the grand champion.
If there's a tie, meaning *both* players choose the same object, then you simply play another round.

Fortunately, your opponent is someone you've studied well.
Based on the motion of their arm, you can tell whether they will (1) play rock or paper with equal probability, (2) play paper or scissors with equal probability or (3) play rock or scissors with equal probability.
(Every round falls into one of these three categories.)

If you strategize correctly, what are your chances of winning the tournament?


## Classic

The inaugural graduating class of Riddler High School, more than 100 students strong, is lined up along the circumference of the giant circular mosaic on the plaza in front of the school.
The principal, Dr. Olivia Rhodes, stands atop a tall stepladder in the center of the circle, preparing to take the panoramic class photo.

Suddenly, she shouts, “Hey, class, every single one of you N graduates—except Val, our valedictorian—is standing in the wrong place!
Remember, you're supposed to stand in order of your class rank, starting with Val directly in front of me, and going counterclockwise all the way to Zach, who should then be next to Val.”
(Poor Zach was ranked last in the graduating class at Riddler High.)

Dr. Rhodes continues, “Not only are almost all of you in the wrong positions, but no two of you are even in the correct position *relative to each other*.”
Two graduates would be in the correct position relative to each other if, for example, graduate A was supposed to be 17 positions counterclockwise of graduate B and was indeed 17 positions counterclockwise of graduate B—even though both graduates were in the wrong positions.

But Val speaks up: “Dr. Rhodes, that can't be right.
There must be at least two of us who are in the correct position relative to each other.”

Dr. Rhodes looks carefully around the circle of graduates below her and admits, “Of course, our brilliant Val is quite right.
I do now see that there are two of you who are correctly positioned relative to each other.”

Given that there are more than 100 graduates, what is the *minimum* number of graduates who are posing for the class photo?
