#How Long Will The Bacterial Colony Last? (12 June 2020)

## Express

There's a technique for rolling dice called “bowling,” in which you place your index finger and thumb on two opposite sides of the die and roll it along the table.
If done correctly, the die will never land on the faces on which you were holding the die, leaving you with a 25 percent chance of landing on each of the remaining four faces.

You'd like to apply this technique to improve your chances of winning a simplified game of craps, in which your goal is simply to roll a 7 or 11 using two dice. With a standard rolling technique, your chances of rolling a 7 or 11 are 2/9, or about 22.2 percent.

Now suppose you're using your bowling technique, and you roll the dice one at a time (i.e., you know the outcome of the first die before rolling the second).
If you play to maximize your chances of rolling a 7 or 11, what will be your chances of winning?

*Extra credit*: Suppose you get one point for rolling a 7 or 11, but now you lose a point for rolling a 2, 3 or 12.
With a standard rolling technique, you'd average 1/9 of a point.
But if you “bowl” to maximize your expected score, what will that average be?

## Classic

You are studying a new strain of bacteria, *Riddlerium classicum* (or *R. classicum*, as the researchers call it).
Each R. classicum bacterium will do one of two things: split into two copies of itself or die.
There is an 80 percent chance of the former and a 20 percent chance of the latter.

If you start with a single *R. classicum* bacterium, what is the probability that it will lead to an everlasting colony (i.e., the colony will theoretically persist for an infinite amount of time)?

*Extra credit*: Suppose that, instead of 80 percent, each bacterium divides with probability *p*.
Now what’s the probability that a single bacterium will lead to an everlasting colony?
